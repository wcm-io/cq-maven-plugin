CQ Maven Plugin Usage
=====================

The usage of this plugin is really simple.

On the commmand line you can type:

```
mvn cq:install
```

instead of having to type

```
mvn install sling:install
```

That's all.

You may need to define some configuration properties to make sure the correct instance URL and credentials are used,
see [plugin documentation](install-mojo.html) for details.
